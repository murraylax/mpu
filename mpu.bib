He cites other central banks around the world taking steps toward transparency including explicitly stating inflation targets, timely release of meeting minutes, frequent public speeches, and regular publication of economic outlooks.  He says it is important that monetary policy be conducted in such a manner because 'improving the public's understanding of the central bank's objectives and policy strategies reduces economic and financial uncertainty and thereby allows businesses and households to make more-informed decisions.'"

The authors look at six developing countries with explicit inflation-targeting policies and examine the consistency between central bank communication and eventual inflation outcomes.  Central bank communications they examine include communicated inflation targets, inflation forecasts, and verbal assessments of the causes of inflation.  Overwhelmingly, they find central bank communication is a good predictor of inflation outcomes, indicating these central banks exhibit transparent and credible policy.  This provides evidence there are central banks around the world that do successfully implement transparent policy."

Of the 23 central banks, 9 explicitly target inflation.  The authors hypothesize that central banks that explicitly target inflation will likely have lower inflation volatility, but possibly at the expense of higher output volatility.  Looking at the data, they do not find this to be the case.  Regardless of whether a central bank was an inflation-targeter or not, all categories of central banks were shown to increase their preference for inflation stabilization in the 1990s from the 1980s, and all categories of central banks' countries experienced lower inflation volatility and lower volatility of output growth.  The empirical evidence suggests that inflation targeting may indeed be effective for limiting volatility of both output and inflation.  One could argue this finding is consistent with Bernanke's (2007) hypothesis that inflation targeting reduces uncertainty and leads businesses and households to make better-informed decisions."

  annote="Like Cecchetti and Erhmann (2002), these authors also examine the relatively stable period since the mid-1980s for a number of countries and ask whether the reduction in inflation volatility and often reductions in output volatility are due to more efficient monetary policy (from a constructed optimal policy prescription found my minimizing a quadratic loss function) or due simply to having the good luck of getting fewer and smaller aggregate supply shocks.  They find that for 20 of the 24 countries analyzed, 80\% of the the reduction in macroeconomic volatility is explained by better monetary policy.  The authors suggest that improved central bank credibility and transparency can account for at least part of the improvement.  It is worth citing this paper if only to show how other researchers have suggested how improved monetary policy has led to improved macroeconomic stability."

They find that monetary policy that has greater levels of transparency and credibility is associated with lower macroeconomic volatility and more efficient monetary policy.  Independence and accountability seem to have little influence.

Specifically, they find the federal funds rate was more sensitive to changes in expected inflation during the Volcker-Greenspan period and show this policy has led to greater macroeconomic stability within the context of a rather simple New Keynesian model.  These findings agree with others that when the central bank puts more weight on inflation movements (while not perhaps having an explicit inflation target) the country is able to maintain a greater degree of macroeconomic stability."

They find increases in inflation leads to higher inflation uncertainty.  They find mixed evidence for the effect inflation uncertainty has on output growth.  Higher inflation uncertainty does not necessarily detrimental to output growth.  For the United States specifically, they find evidence for the negative impact of inflation uncertainty on output growth only when using the PPI to measure inflation, and not for the CPI.  The authors also find little to no evidence that output growth uncertainty affects output growth or inflation, either positively or negatively.  We could argue the authors findings are consistent with ours in that we do not find evidence that monetary policy uncertainty affects output growth or inflation."
